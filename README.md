# TeaLeafNet: A Hybrid CNN-Boosting Approach for Tea Leaf disease Classification


# Tea Leaf Disease Classification

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting tea leaf diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project involves the use of a dataset comprising images of tea leaves under various conditions, including both healthy and diseased leaves.

## Objectives

### Dataset Preparation:

- Utilized a dataset of tea leaf images sourced from multiple providers.
- Sorted the dataset based on different factors, including the type of disease.

### CNN Investigation:

- Explored multiple convolutional neural network architectures for visual recognition of tea leaf diseases.

### Model Development:

- Proposed a comprehensive machine learning model for assessment.
- The model includes an encoder-decoder CNN-Boosting and incorporates two pre-trained CNN models with transfer learning (TL).

### Performance Evaluation:

- Evaluated the performance of the CNN-Boosting model using fundamental evaluation measures, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
